1. Unzip the project.

2. Open Command Line or Terminal and change the directory to the backend:
   cd backend

3. Activate the Python virtual environment:
   - If there is no `.venv` file, create one:
     python -m venv .venv
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
     - On macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

4. Install requirements in both backend and scanner folder:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ../scanner
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Change directory back to backend:
   cd ../backend

6. If there is no database created, initialize the database:
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade

   - Note: SQLite is required to test locally.
   - For production on a server, use PostgreSQL instead.

7. Run the backend application:
   flask run

8. Open another terminal, change the directory to frontend:
   cd frontend

9. Install frontend dependencies:
   npm install

10. Run the frontend application:
    npm run dev

11. For production:
    - Backend can be hosted on Heroku
    - Frontend can be hosted on Vercel
    - After hosting, update the API URLs in the frontend code according to the backend URL
